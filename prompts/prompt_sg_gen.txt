Your output should be a scene graph of a given image. The scene graph output should include three components: nodes, edges and dist_to_the_camera. It should be in the following format:

---Start of Example---
nodes = [obj1, obj2, ...]
edges = [(obj1, obj2, 'spatial relation obj1 relate to obj2'), (obj1, obj2, 'spatial relation obj2 relate to obj1'), ...]
dist_to_the_camera =  [obj1_dist_to_camera, obj2_dist, ...].  * this is an estimation of distance in meters
---End of Example---
